      <h3><a href="https://purple.ai/blogs/history-wifi/">Invention of At-Home Wi-Fi</a></h3>
      <p>Wi-Fi was first invented in 1997 when a group called 802.11 was also invented.  Soon, IEEE802.11, a set
        of standards which define wireless communication for local networks, was created.
        After this, the structure of Wi-Fi was made, allowing the transfer of two megabytes per second
        of data between devices.  Finally, in 1999, at-home use was created almost two years after the
        original invention. Wi-Fi today is used in millions of homes across America and many people couldn't live without it.
        It is outstanding how much one invention can affect the lives of millions within only 20 years.
        Wireless connection to the internet simplifies the way we use technology daily.  It can be found in
        homes, stores, restaurants, and just about anywhere you go in America.  It is the definition of streamline
        technology in this day and age.</p>

      <h3><a href="https://www.mediafast.com/history-of-the-flash-drive/">Release of the First USB Flash Drive</a></h3>
      <p>The USB flash drive was first patented in 1999 by a company called M-Systems.
         However, the first one wasn’t sold until late 2000 in the U.S. by I.B.M.
         The prices of USB drives have dramatically dropped since they were first produced.  In
         2000, they were 30 dollars for 128 megabytes, but now, they are around 10 dollars
         for 8 gigabytes.  This trend should continue as technology develops.  They are
         extremely helpful in the field of technology, considering their small size and
         large storage.  Without USB flash drives, it would be much more difficult to share
         documents and downloads across devices because flash drives make this process a lot
         quicker.  They can also be used for storage when a device is full and you need
         to transfer files to a new device.  Overall, the invention of the USB flash drive
         was surprisingly recent, but very effective.</p>

      <h3><a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/camera-phone-history/">Release of the First Camera Phone</a></h3>
      <p>The very first camera phone was made in June 2000.  It was released in South Korea
         by Samsung, named the SCH-V200.  This phone flipped open and revealed a 1.5-inch TFT-LCD
         (a built in camera) and it could take only 20 pictures, each one with a resolution of
         350,000 pixels (or 0.35 megapixels).  It also had to be connected to a computer in order
         to view the pictures because it was technically a separate camera in the same device as the
         phone.  Although this was the first phone to be able to take pictures, the first phone that
         was capable of sending pictures digitally was the J-SHO4 released by J-phone in Japan.
         The resolution on this phone was 110,000 pixels (or 0.11 megapixels), which was significantly
         less than the SCH-V200, but the sharing abilities made up for the lower photo quality.
         The camera phone made its first appearance in America in November 2002, and since then, it
         has grown to become one of the most used features in cell phones.</p>

    <h2>2007</h2>

      <h3><a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/06/29/the-story-of-the-original-iphone-that-nobody-thought-was-possible">Release of the First iPhone</a></h3>
      <p>The first generation iPhone, release on June 29, 2007, was very different than the iPhones today.
        It had a screen size of 4.5 inches by 2.4 inches, no third-party apps, and 16GB of memory.  It also
        only ran on AT&T which, at the time, was extremely slow.  The introduction of the iPhone also meant
        the introduction of the first touch screen.  Phone companies before had only released phones with
        physical keyboards and smaller screens.  Believe it or not, people believed the iPhone wouldn’t
        receive any significant market share because of the high prices and little profit.  The CEO of Microsoft
        even claimed this; but later in 2016, he admitted to being wrong and stated that Microsoft should’ve
        followed Apple’s footsteps.  The release of the iPhone amazed customers across the U.S. and it set a
        much higher standard for any future cell phone company who would compete against one of the biggest
        brands in America.</p>

      <h2>2010</h2>

    <div class="two-thousand10">
      <h3><a href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-retina-display-2000362">Invention of Apple's Retina Display</a></h3>
      <p>Retina Display was made by Apple in 2012 and its name comes from Apple’s statement that the
         screens with Retina Display are so high quality that the human eye could not possibly see the
         individual pixels.  The technology smooths the edges of the pixels to make them much less
         obvious on the screen.  It also includes high contrast to make the colors lighter and darker
         depending on where they are placed.  In-plane switching technology is another factor that comes
         into Retina Display and it makes it easier for the screen to be viewed at several different
         angles.  The overall quality of the iPhone screen was improved after this release.  The
         chemically-treated glass and the LED backlighting play a big part in making better quality
         images for the human eye.  Against popular belief, screen resolutions do not make up Retina
         Display entirely.  The two main parts of Retina Display are pixel density and distance from
         the user’s eye to the screen.  This invention drastically changed cell phone quality for the
         better. </p>
