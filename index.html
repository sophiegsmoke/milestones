      <h3>The Invention of At-Home Wi-Fi</h3>
      <p>Wi-Fi was first invented in 1997 when a group called 802.11 was also invented.  Soon, IEEE802.11, a set
        <br>of standards which define wireless communication for local networks, was created.
        <br>After this, the structure of Wi-Fi was made, allowing the transfer of two megabytes per second
        <br>of data between devices.  Finally, in 1999, aat-home use was created almost two years after the
        <br>original invention.</p>

      <h3>The Release of the First USB Flash Drive</h3>
      <p>The USB flash drive was first patented in 1999 by a company called M-Systems.
         However, the first one wasnâ€™t sold until late 2000 in the U.S. by I.B.M.
         The prices of USB drives have dramatically dropped since they were first produced.  In
         2000, they were 30 dollars for 128 megabytes, but now, they are around 10 dollars
         for 8 gigabytes.  This trend should continue as technology develops.  They are
         extremely helpful in the field of technology, considering their small size and
         large storage.  Without USB flash drives, it would be much more difficult to share
         documents and downloads across devices because flash drives make this process a lot
         quicker.  They can also be used for storage when a device is full and you need
         to transfer files to a new device.  Overall, the invention of the USB flash drive
         was surprisingly recent, but very effective.</p>
