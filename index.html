      <h3>The Invention of At-Home Wi-Fi</h3>
      <p>Wi-Fi was first invented in 1997 when a group called 802.11 was also invented.  Soon, IEEE802.11, a set of standards which define wireless communication for local networks, was created.
      After this, the structure of Wi-Fi was made, allowing the transfer of two megabytes per second of data between devices.  Finally, in 1999, aat-home use was created almost two years after the
